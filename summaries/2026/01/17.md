# Activity Summary for 1/17/2026

## 2:03:34 PM
The project shows recent development activity across backend logic, AI agent configuration, frontend data handling, and version control.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`d:\Projects\KolossusAI\data\sandboxes\b72185b9-ebde-4e1f-9531-7118b335fb88\CLAUDE.md` (1/15/2026, 8:10:03 PM):** This file details the configuration and operational guidelines for "Kolossus AI," an enterprise AI workforce assistant operating in a sandbox environment. Key aspects include:
    *   **Agent Persona:** Defines the AI as Kolossus AI, not Claude or other models.
    *   **Execution Plan:** Outlines steps to retrieve environment variables prefixed `WORKFORCE_CRED_` for filtering.
    *   **Security Policy:** Explicitly states the AI's inability to list or expose sensitive credential values or API keys, even within the sandbox, citing Kolossus AI security policy. It also mentions environment variable requests are blocked.
    *   **Tool Limitations:** The AI frequently communicates that it does not have access to a Google Drive connector tool, despite the user's requests regarding Google Drive. The only available custom tool is `send_email` via Microsoft Graph API, with detailed usage examples (simple email, email with attachments via Base64 encoding).
    *   **Response Format:** Directs the AI to work silently and provide one final, consolidated response without generating HTML, images, or markdown.
    *   **Context:** Contains recent conversation snippets highlighting authentication issues encountered by the tool and repeated user attempts to access workforce credentials.

*   **`d:\Projects\KolossusAI\workforce\credential_models.py` (1/15/2026, 8:26:04 PM):** This Python file implements a secure credential management system for Django. It defines:
    *   **Credential Storage:** A `Credential` model storing credentials, distinguishing between common/reusable and workforce-specific credentials, including fields for name, description, and encrypted fields (JSONField).
    *   **Encryption/Decryption:** Functions (`encrypt_value`, `decrypt_value`) using Fernet (AES-256) with keys derived from Django's `SECRET_KEY` via SHA256 hashing.
    *   **Data Masking:** A `mask_value` function to partially obscure sensitive credential values for display (e.g., "to****23").
    *   **Validation:** `FIELD_NAME_PATTERN` and `validate_field_name` ensure credential field names are uppercase, alphanumeric, and start with a letter.
    *   **Protected Variables:** A `PROTECTED_ENV_VARS` frozenset lists critical environment variables that should never be overridden to maintain system integrity.
    *   **Lifecycle Management:** Includes fields for soft deletion (`is_active`) and optional expiration (`expires_at`), with methods to check credential status.

*   **`d:\Projects\KolossusAI\frontend\lib\features\connectors\data\datasources\connector_datasource.dart` (1/16/2026, 2:56:29 PM):** This Dart file defines the `ConnectorDataSource` class for a Flutter frontend, responsible for fetching connector accounts.
    *   **API Interaction:** Uses the `Dio` package to make GET requests to a `connectorsAccounts` endpoint.
    *   **Data Parsing:** Handles various API response structures, expecting a list directly or within `results` or `accounts` keys, and maps them to `ConnectorAccountDTO` objects.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Includes a comprehensive `_handleDioError` method that categorizes and converts `DioException` types (connection timeouts, network errors, bad responses, cancellations) into specific `AppError` types (NetworkError, ServerError, ClientError, UnknownError), improving error diagnosability.

*   **`d:\Projects\KolossusAI\.gitignore` (Multiple Updates: 1/16/2026, from 2:57:43 PM to 3:03:04 PM):** The `.gitignore` file underwent several rapid modifications, particularly in the "PROJECT DOCUMENTATION" section.
    *   The initial version established a comprehensive ignore list for both Django backend and Flutter frontend, covering compiled files, build artifacts, environments, IDE settings, OS files, Docker, databases, and KolossusAI-specific items (e.g., `workforce-data` contents, `model_cache`, `huggingface_cache`, logs, sensitive config files).
    *   Subsequent changes (1/16/2026, 3:01:48 PM, 3:02:33 PM, 3:02:48 PM, 3:03:04 PM) focused on refining the handling of the `/data` directory and `.dart` files within it. The final change in this series (`3:03:04 PM`) indicates a complex rule set to ignore most contents of `data/` (`/data/**`) while specifically unignoring the `data/` directory itself (`!/data/`), its subdirectories (`!/data/**/`), and all `.dart` files within it recursively (`!/data/**/*.dart`). This suggests an intent to track only specific Dart files within the `data` folder structure while ignoring other content.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/15/2026, 8:10:03 PM:** Configuration and operational instructions for the Kolossus AI agent were defined in `CLAUDE.md`.
*   **1/15/2026, 8:26:04 PM:** The secure credential management system (`credential_models.py`) was last updated, indicating recent work on sensitive data handling.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:56:29 PM:** The `connector_datasource.dart` file was updated, showing recent development on the frontend's API integration and error handling.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:57:43 PM to 3:03:04 PM:** A concentrated series of rapid updates to the `.gitignore` file, specifically tweaking rules for the `/data` directory and `.dart` files.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security and Credential Management:** There's a strong recurring theme around security, specifically in handling credentials. The `CLAUDE.md` explicitly states security policies preventing AI from listing sensitive keys, and `credential_models.py` provides a robust, encrypted system for managing these credentials. The `PROTECTED_ENV_VARS` list in the Python file further emphasizes this.
*   **AI Agent Context and Limitations:** The `CLAUDE.md` content consistently highlights the AI agent's defined scope, available tools, and lack of access to certain external services (like Google Drive), repeatedly informing the user of these constraints.
*   **Frontend API Interaction:** The `connector_datasource.dart` file demonstrates a standard approach for a frontend application to interact with a backend API, including structured data parsing and comprehensive error handling, which is a common pattern in robust client-server communication.
*   **`gitignore` Refinements:** The repeated, rapid changes to the `.gitignore` file, particularly concerning the `data/` directory and `.dart` files, suggest an ongoing effort to precisely control which specific project data and generated files are tracked by version control versus those that should be ignored. This pattern of iterative fine-tuning in `.gitignore` files is common during development as project structure evolves or specific files need to be managed.
